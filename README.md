# FastQuality
Tiny program intended to shift FASTQ quality scores

###How to use ?

You need python 2.7 (or greater, I didn't try, but I guess it'll work just as well) and the argparse module.

python shiftFastQ.py -i "YourFASTQFile" -s "Number to shift"

You can give in negative or positive values for -s parameter
